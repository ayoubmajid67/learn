# Learning Journey

This repository is a place where I document my progress as I dive into new areas of knowledge and skills, especially in tech fields like web development. Here, I keep track of what I'm learning, from general concepts to more advanced topics, and reflect on how each new skill builds on my overall understanding.

## Overview

This repo covers my ongoing journey in learning:
- **Web Development**: Gaining experience with both front-end and back-end development.
- **Programming Tools & Techniques**: Exploring tools, libraries, and workflows that help in building and organizing projects effectively.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Creating projects to apply what I learn and solidify concepts through hands-on practice.

This is a living record of my progress, where each update represents a step forward in my learning path.
