# Learning Journey

This repository is where I document my progress as I explore new areas of knowledge and skills, especially in tech fields like web development. Here, I track what I'm learning, from general concepts to more advanced topics, and reflect on how each new skill builds on my overall understanding.

## Overview

This repository covers my ongoing journey in:
- **Web Development**: Building experience in both front-end and back-end development.
- **Programming Tools & Techniques**: Exploring tools, libraries, and workflows that help organize and enhance projects.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Applying new concepts by creating projects to solidify my skills through hands-on practice.

This is a living record of my progress, where each update marks a step forward in my learning path.
