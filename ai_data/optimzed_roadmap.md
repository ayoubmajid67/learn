## 🚀 Optimized Roadmap for AI & Data Engineer (3–4 months)

### ✅ 1. **Deepen Core AI Knowledge**

Since you've already done ML basics (classification, data pipelines), focus now on:

#### 🧠 What to Learn:

* Neural Networks (forward/backpropagation)
* Deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
* Regularization, optimization
* Fine-tuning, overfitting, evaluation

#### 📘 Recommended Course:

🔗 [DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) *(Free audit available)*
🎓 **Industry Value**: Very respected. Created by Andrew Ng.

### ✅ 3. **Build 2–4 Portfolio Projects**

✅ Apply your skills to real, impressive projects:

#### 💡 Examples:

1. **RAG-powered search assistant** (PDF/CSV/Docs)
2. **Resume Evaluator / LLM chatbot**
3. **Real-time KPI Dashboard with AI suggestions**
4. **Your own ChatGPT-style LLM clone (LangChain)**

These prove you know **data pipelines, GenAI, backend orchestration**, and **business value**.
