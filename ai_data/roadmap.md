## 🧭 Roadmap to Becoming an AI & Data Engineer

**For software engineers starting to specialize in AI + data (with GenAI focus)**

---

### ✅ **PHASE 1: Core Machine Learning Foundations (2–3 weeks)**

Start here before going deep into GenAI — it's essential to understand how models work.

#### 🔸 What to Learn:

* Supervised learning: regression, classification
* Overfitting, underfitting
* Loss functions, metrics (MSE, accuracy, precision/recall)
* Model evaluation & validation techniques

#### 📘 Course:

* [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression &amp; Classification (Andrew Ng – Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* ✅ FREE if audited

#### 🛠️ Practice:

* Kaggle [Intro to ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) & [Intermediate ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)

---

### ✅ **PHASE 2: Data Engineering & Pipeline Skills (3–4 weeks)**

These are must-have skills for any AI or data engineer.

#### 🔸 What to Learn:

* SQL (joins, CTEs, window functions, optimization)
* Data cleaning & preprocessing (Pandas, missing values)
* ETL/ELT pipelines
* Data modeling: star/snowflake schema
* Workflow orchestration (Airflow or Prefect)

#### 📘 Courses:

* [Data Engineering Zoomcamp (FREE)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)
* [Kaggle SQL Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql)

#### 🛠️ Tools:

* PostgreSQL or BigQuery (for SQL)
* Airflow (workflow orchestration)
* dbt (data modeling, optional)

---

### ✅ **PHASE 3: Deep Learning & Neural Networks (3 weeks)**

To move beyond APIs and fine-tune or train your own models.

#### 🔸 What to Learn:

* Neural networks (forward/backpropagation)
* CNNs (for vision), RNNs (for sequence), Transformers (for NLP)
* Loss functions, optimizers
* Overfitting, dropout, batch norm

#### 📘 Courses:

* [DeepLearning.AI Specialization (Andrew Ng, Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) *(Free audit available)*
* [Practical Deep Learning for Coders (fast.ai)](https://course.fast.ai/)

#### 🛠️ Tools:

* PyTorch (or TensorFlow if preferred)

---

### ✅ **PHASE 4: Generative AI for Developers (3 weeks)**

This is where your recent interest lies — and it’s a great “builder” phase.

#### 📘 Course:

* [Generative AI Full Course for Developers – @dswithbappy](https://youtu.be/F0GQ0l2NfHA?si=MuvUMQ1fTdQUeF3A)

#### 🔸 What You’ll Learn:

* LLMs, embeddings, transformers
* LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* Vector databases (Chroma, FAISS)
* Deployment: Google Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock
* Prompt engineering & agent tools

#### 🛠️ Project Ideas:

* RAG-based chatbot for PDF/CSV data
* Text summarizer with custom prompts
* Code doc assistant powered by OpenAI + LangChain
* Deploy an AI assistant via Streamlit + GCP

---

### ✅ **PHASE 5: Portfolio & Positioning (Ongoing)**

Start sharing & documenting your work publicly.

#### 🧰 What to Do:

* GitHub repos with clean README, setup, and examples
* Medium/Hashnode posts explaining what you built
* LinkedIn posts with images, use cases, and takeaways

#### 🎯 Suggested Projects to Showcase:

* AI Data Pipeline (ETL + BI Dashboard + KPIs)
* GenAI Search over docs (LLM + Chroma + LangChain)
* Fine-tuned LLM assistant for a niche (e.g. legal docs, resumes)
* Real-time KPI dashboard from CSV/SQL to Power BI or Streamlit
