Description: Model definition and training


üß† 1. What is a .pkl file?

A .pkl file (Pickle file) is a serialized Python object, meaning it stores your trained model (or any Python object) in binary format.
You can load it later to make predictions instantly ‚Äî no need to retrain the model again.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. When to Save It
You save your model after training ‚Äî for example, at the end of your train_knn() function or in your main.py.
