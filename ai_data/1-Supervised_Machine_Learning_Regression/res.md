### 🔹 **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**

The broadest field — includes any system that mimics human thinking (rules or data-driven).
**Examples:** Virtual assistants, self-driving tech.

### 🔹 **ML (Machine Learning)**

A subset of AI — systems that **learn from data** to predict or decide.
**Examples:** Spam filters, recommendations.

### 🔹 **DL (Deep Learning)**

A subset of ML — uses **neural networks** for complex tasks like image or speech recognition.
**Examples:** Face ID, language translation.

### 🔹 **Generative AI**

A branch of DL — creates new content like **text, images, or code**.
**Examples:** ChatGPT, DALL·E, GitHub Copilot.
