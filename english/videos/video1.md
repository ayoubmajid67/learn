## New sentences

Add any sentences you want to practice or extract from the video below. Use bullet points for each sentence and include timestamps if helpful.

- (00:00) Example sentence 1 — write the sentence here.
- (00:45) Example sentence 2 — write the sentence here.

## Notes

- Keep one sentence per bullet.
- Add the original timestamp in parentheses at the start of each bullet.
- Optionally add a short paraphrase or translation after the sentence.

## TODO

- [ ] Extract key vocabulary from the video
- [ ] Create flashcards from sentences above

## Recordings

Add your recorded audio files (practicing sentences or shadowing the speaker) to a `recordings/` folder next to this file or inside `videos/`.

Suggested structure and naming:

- recordings/video1_sentence_00-00.mp3  — recording for timestamp 00:00
- recordings/video1_sentence_00-45.mp3  — recording for timestamp 00:45

Tips:

- Use MP3 or M4A for broad compatibility.
- Keep filenames short and include timestamps to match bullets above.
- If you want, add waveform or duration metadata in the sentence bullets like `(00:00) — 12s`.
