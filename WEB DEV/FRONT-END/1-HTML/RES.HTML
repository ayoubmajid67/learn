html  element => tag : 

html element => <html></html> parent of all  (head body footer .) 
head element => <head></head> contains info about the page : (meta)
body element => <body></body>  cover all element in the page 

basic structure : ---------------------[-]
<html>
  <head>
    information about the page 
  </head>

  <body>
    cover all element of the page 
  </body>

</html>

head element : ---------------------[-]
title element => <title>Page name</title>  set the name of the page

<!-- head and nested elements  -->

meta element => <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
1- WHAT IS IT ? 
The charset attribute, often used in the <meta> tag of an HTML document,
specifies the character encoding used in the document.
Character encoding defines how characters in the document
are represented as binary data.
It's crucial to specify the correct character encoding to ensure
that the web browser interprets and displays the text correctly

2- The most common charset:
 ✨UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit)
 ✨ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1): 
 ✨UTF-16:

meta element => <meta name="description" content="Text">
1- what is it ?
The HTML <meta> element with the name="description"
attribute is used to provide a brief description of a web page's content.
This description is often used by search engines and web crawlers
as a summary of the page's content, and it may be displayed in search
engine results.
✨name="description" specifies that this <meta> 
✨element is providing a description.
content="This is a brief description of the content of my web page." i

2-advantage ?
Having a well-crafted meta description is essential for search engine 
optimization (SEO) because it can influence whether users click 
on your page when it appears in search results. 
It's a good practice to write informative and engaging descriptions 
that accurately represent the content of your web page. 

meta E=><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

1-what is it? 
  The HTML `<meta>` element with the `name="viewport"` attribute is used to 
  control how a web page is displayed on different devices,
  particularly on mobile devices. 
  It helps ensure that the web page's layout and text are properly 
  scaled and adapted to the screen size of the device.

✨`width=device-width`: This sets the width of the viewport to be equal to
 the device's width. In other words, it ensures that the web page's 
 content adjusts to fit the screen width of the device, which is essential 
 for responsive design.

✨- `initial-scale=1.0`: This sets the initial zoom level when the web page
   is first loaded. A value of `1.0` means no zooming is applied,
   so the web page is initially displayed at its natural size. Users can then zoom 
   in or out as needed.

2-advantage ?
  Including this `<meta>` tag with these attributes is a common practice 
  in responsive web design. It helps create a better user experience by making 
  sure that web pages are readable and usable on a variety of screen sizes and devices,
  from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.

<!-- doctype standard & quirks mode  -->
doctype element => <!DOCTYPE html>  =>  identifier the html version : 
 the DOCTYPE declaration in HTML specifies the version of HTML being 
 used and can affect how web browsers render web pages.
 Standard mode follows modern web standards, while quirks mode emulates older,
 non-standard behavior for compatibility with legacy web content.



1- if you don't specify the doctype :  
 the quirks mode is working  => don't support some of  elements 
 In quirks mode, the web browser behaves as if it is rendering content according
 to older, non-standard specifications. This mode is primarily
 used to ensure backward compatibility with older web pages that 
 were designed before modern web standards.
 
 ✨An example of a DOCTYPE declaration that triggers quirks mode for HTML 4.01 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">


2- otherwise  : 
 the standard mode is working => support all :
 This declaration signals that you are using HTML5, which is the latest HTML
 specification as of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021.
 In standard mode, the web browser should render the page according to the HTML5 
 specification.  

 ✨an example of html5:
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- heading and use cases -->
heading element => <h1>large one</h1> <h2></h2> <h3></h3> <h4></h4> <h5></h5> <h6></h6>

<!-- syntax and Tests -->

2- you can put   an element code in multiple line : 
<meta name="viewport" 
content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"> 

3- the value of attribute can be in single coat '' or double coat or nothing 
if  it's one word : 
example:
<meta charset="UTF-8"

In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the concepts of syntax and testing 
are important for creating well-structured and functional web pages. 
Here's how these concepts apply to HTML:

1. **Syntax in HTML**:
   -✨ **HTML Syntax**: HTML has its own set of rules and syntax for structuring web 
   content. HTML documents are composed of elements and tags, and they follow a
    hierarchical structure. Elements are enclosed in angle brackets, and tags 
    consist of an opening tag `<tag>` and a closing tag `</tag>`, if applicable.
   
   -✨ **Attributes**: HTML elements often have attributes that provide additional
    information about the element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag
     and have a name and a value, separated by an equal sign, e.g., `attribute="value"`.
   
   -✨ **Proper Nesting**: Elements should be properly nested within each other. 
    For example, a `<div>` element should not be placed inside a `<p>` element.
     Proper nesting ensures the correct rendering of web content.
   
   -✨ **Valid HTML**: It's essential to write HTML code that adheres 
   to the HTML specifications. You can use validation tools like the W3C Markup 
   Validation Service to check your HTML documents for syntax errors and ensure 
   they conform to the standards.

2. **Testing in HTML**:
   -✨ **HTML Validation**: Testing HTML documents for validity is crucial.
    The W3C Markup Validation Service mentioned above can help identify syntax errors
     and non-compliance with HTML standards.
  
   -✨**Cross-Browser Testing**: HTML pages may render differently in different web
    browsers. Cross-browser testing involves testing your web pages in various browsers
     to ensure they appear and function consistently across different platforms.

   -✨**Responsive Design Testing**: If your web pages are designed to be responsive 
   (adapting to different screen sizes and devices), you should test them on various 
   devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones, 
   to ensure they display correctly.

   -✨**Accessibility Testing**: Ensure that your HTML content is accessible
    to users with disabilities. Testing includes checking for proper semantic HTML,
     keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

   -✨**Functional Testing**: If your web page contains interactive elements or forms,
    you should test their functionality to ensure they work as intended.
     This involves checking user interactions, form submissions, and error handling.

In HTML, writing clean and valid code, along with thorough testing,
 is essential for creating web pages that work reliably and provide a positive user 
 experience. HTML validation tools and testing methodologies are valuable
  resources to help ensure the quality and correctness of your HTML documents.


  <!-- PARAGRAPH ELEMENT :  -->
  <p>test</p> => block element : 

  <!-- block and inline element : -->
  In HTML and CSS, elements are classified into two primary categories:
  block-level elements and inline elements. 
  These classifications determine how elements behave in terms of layout 
  and how they interact with other elements on a web page.

1-Block-Level Elements:-----[-]

✨Definition:
Block-level elements are those elements that typically create a "block" 
or rectangular box on a web page, and they often start on a new line.
They span the full width of their parent container by default.

✨Examples:
Common block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <li>, <table>, 
and <form>, among others.

✨Behavior:
Block-level elements create a visual separation between content,
 and each block-level element typically starts on a new line.
They can contain other block-level and inline elements, 
creating a hierarchical structure.
You can control their width, height, margins, and padding.

2-Inline Elements:-----[-]

✨Definition:
Inline elements, as the name suggests, do not create a new block or line but
 flow within the text or content of a block-level element.
They only take up as much width as necessary for their content.

✨Examples:
Common inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <br>, and <i>, 
among others.

✨Behavior:
Inline elements do not create a visual break or new line; they flow with the surrounding
text or content.They cannot contain block-level elements but can contain other inline
elements.You can control their width, height, margins, and padding to some extent, 
but they won't affect the layout as much as block-level elements.

<!-- element attributes -->
In HTML, element attributes are additional pieces of information that can be 
added to HTML elements to provide extra details or functionality. 
Attributes are always specified in the opening tag of an HTML element and are written
 as name-value pairs. Here's a brief overview of some common HTML attributes:

✨id Attribute:
Used to uniquely identify an element on a web page. IDs must be unique within a document.
Example: <div id="header">...</div>

✨class Attribute:
Used to assign one or more class names to an element. Classes are often used to apply CSS
 styles or JavaScript functionality to multiple elements.
Example: <p class="highlighted">...</p>

✨src Attribute:
Typically used with elements like <img> <script></script> and <iframe>
 to specify the source file or URL for the element's content.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">

✨href Attribute:
Used with <a> elements to specify the URL to which the link points.
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

✨alt Attribute:
Used with <img> elements to provide alternative text that describes the image. 
It's important for accessibility and SEO.
Example: <img src="icon.png" alt="An icon">

✨title Attribute:
Provides additional information about an element. Often displayed as a tooltip when the user
 hovers over the element.
Example: <a href="page.html" title="Visit this page">Link</a>

✨style Attribute:
Used to inline CSS styles directly within an HTML element. 
Can be used for quick styling but is generally not recommended for larger projects.
Example: <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">Styled text</p>

✨disabled Attribute:
Used with form elements like <input> and <button> to disable their functionality.
Example: <input type="text" disabled>

✨placeholder Attribute:
Used with form input elements to provide a hint or example text that disappears
 when the user starts typing.
Example: <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">

✨data-* Attributes:
Custom attributes starting with data- that allow you to store custom data in HTML
 elements. These can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.
Example: <div data-user-id="123">...</div>

These are just a few examples of common HTML attributes.
Different elements have specific attributes that are relevant to their purpose
 and functionality. Understanding how to use attributes is important for building 
 effective and interactive web pages.

<!-- formatting Element  -->

b element => <b>Text</b> => bold Text 
strong element => <strong>text</strong> => bold && important 
i element => <i>text</i>  => italic 
em element => <em>text</em> => Emphasized
mark element=> <mark>text</mark> => highlighted text 
u element => <u>text</u> => underline 
small element=> <small>text</small> => small text   
del element => <del>test</del> => deleted test :  || discounted price 
ins element => <ins>text</ins> => inserted text : 
sub element=> <sub>text</sub> => subscript :under  
example : <p>h<sub>2</sub>o</p>
sup element => <sub>text</sub> => superscript :above
example:  <p>x<sup>2</sup></p>



<!-- link and anchor tag  -->

<!--  a element -->
<a href="URL"  target="">google</a>

0-href attribute : 
The `href` attribute is a fundamental attribute used in HTML anchor (`<a>`) 
  elements to define a hyperlink. It specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
   of the resource that the link points to. Here's all you need to know about the 
   `href` attribute in anchor elements:

  1. **Basic Usage:**
     ```html
     <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
     ```
  
     In this example, the `href` attribute is set to "https://www.example.com,"
     which is the URL of the target resource. When a user clicks on the link
     text "Visit Example.com," the browser will navigate to the URL specified
     in the `href` attribute.
  
  2. **Relative URLs:**
  
     The `href` attribute can also contain relative URLs, which are URLs that are
     relative to the current document's location. Relative URLs are often used
      when linking to resources within the same website.
  
     ```html
     <a href="/about.html">About Us</a>
     ```
  
     In this case, clicking the "About Us" link would navigate 
     to the "about.html" page in the root directory of the current website.
  
  3. **Email Links:**
  
     The `href` attribute can be used to create email links,
      which allow users to send emails to a specified email address 
      when they click the link.
  
     ```html
     <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">Contact Us</a>
     ```
  
     Clicking the "Contact Us" link would open the default email
      client with a new email message addressed to "contact@example.com."
  
  4. **Anchors to Page Sections:**
  
     The `href` attribute can also link to specific sections within the
      same web page by using fragment identifiers. For example:
  
     ```html
     <a href="#section1">Jump to Section 1</a>
     ```
  
     In this case, clicking the link would scroll the page 
     to the element with the `id` attribute of "section1."
  
  5. **JavaScript Actions:**
  
     You can use the `href` attribute to trigger JavaScript actions
      or functions when the link is clicked by setting the attribute to
       a JavaScript statement or function call.
  
     ```html
     <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="myFunction();">Click Me</a>
     ```
  
     Here, clicking the link would execute the JavaScript
      function `myFunction()`.
  
  6. **Downloading Files:**
  
     The `href` attribute can link to downloadable files, 
     such as PDFs or documents, allowing users to download the
      file when they click the link.
  
     ```html
     <a href="documents/my-document.pdf" download>Download PDF</a>
     ```
  
     The `download` attribute, when present, suggests to the browser 
     that the linked target should be downloaded instead of navigating to it.
  
  7. **Targeting Frames or Windows:**
  
     The `href` attribute can be used in conjunction with the `target` 
     attribute to specify where the linked content should be displayed 
     or opened. For example, `target="_blank"` will open the link in a new browser window or tab.
  
     ```html
     <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>
     ```
  
  The `href` attribute is a versatile attribute that allows you to 
  create various types of hyperlinks, from simple external links to complex 
  navigational elements and interactions on web pages. Its usage depends 
  on the specific requirements of your web project.



1- target  attribute:
In HTML, the target attribute is used within anchor (<a>) and form (<>) 
  elements to specify where the linked content or form submission results 
  should be displayed or opened. The target attribute determines the context 
  in which the linked resource or form action should be loaded or displayed. 
  Here are some common values for the target attribute:

  ✨ _blank: When you set target="_blank", it opens the linked content or form 
  submission result in a new browser window or tab. This is commonly used when you 
  want to open a link or form submission in a separate browsing context.
 
  ✨ example:
  <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>
  
  ✨_self: This is the default behavior.
   It opens the linked content or form submission result in the same window 
   or frame where the link was clicked or form was submitted. 
   You typically don't need to specify this explicitly unless you want 
   to override a previously set target attribute.
  
   ✨ example:
   <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_self">Open in the same window</a>


2-target for  anchor links------------[-]

In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the `:target` pseudo-class is used 
to select and style an HTML element that is the target of a fragment
 identifier in the URL. It's commonly used to create interactive web pages
  with anchor links that navigate to different sections of a document.

Here's how it works:

1. **HTML Structure:** In your HTML document, you define sections or elements with
 `id` attributes. These `id` attributes are used as fragment identifiers in the URL.

   ```html
   <div id="section1">
       <!-- Content for section 1 goes here -->
   </div>

   <div id="section2">
       <!-- Content for section 2 goes here -->
   </div>
   ```

2. **Anchor Links:** You create anchor links in your HTML document that link 
to these sections. These links use the `href` attribute to specify 
the fragment identifier (the `id` of the target element).

   ```html
   <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
   <a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
   ```

3. **CSS with :target:** You can apply CSS styles to the target element using 
the `:target` pseudo-class. When a link with a matching `href` is clicked,
 the corresponding target element becomes the "target" and can be styled 
 accordingly.

   ```css
   #section1:target {
       background-color: yellow;
   }

   #section2:target {
       background-color: lightblue;
   }
   ```

4. **Behavior:** When you click on one of the anchor links, the URL in the browser's
 address bar changes to include the fragment identifier (e.g., `#section1`). 
 This makes the corresponding element with the matching `id` the target, 
 and the CSS styles specified for `:target` will be applied.

So, in this example, when you click the "Go to Section 1" link, 
the background color of `#section1` will turn yellow.
 Clicking "Go to Section 2" will change the background color of `#section2` 
 to light blue.

`:target` can be used for various interactive purposes on web pages,
 such as creating navigation menus, one-page scrolling sites, 
 or highlighting content sections when linked to from a table of contents.
 It provides a way to style elements based on user interaction and URL
 fragment identifiers.

  /* html entities  */
  HTML entities are special codes or sequences of characters used in HTML to represent 
  characters that have special meanings or are not easily typed directly from the keyboard. 
  They are used to display characters that might otherwise be misinterpreted by browsers
   or to represent characters that have no direct keyboard input.

HTML entities start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`). 
Here are some common HTML entities and their corresponding characters:

1. **Character Entities:**

   - `&amp` - Represents the ampersand character (`&`).
   - `&lt` - Represents the less-than symbol (`<`).
   - `&gt` - Represents the greater-than symbol (`>`).
   - `&quot` - Represents double quotation marks (`"`).
   - `&apos` - Represents single quotation marks (apostrophes) (`'`).

  
2. **Numeric Character References:**

   Numeric character references allow you to represent characters using their 
   Unicode code points. You use the format `&#xxx`, where `xxx` is the
  decimal representation of the character's Unicode code point.
   Example:
   ```html
  '&#169' => copyright icon  
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   © 2023 MyWebsite.com
   ```

3. **Named Entities:**

   Named entities provide a more human-readable way to represent 
   special characters. For example, `&copy` represents the copyright 
   symbol ©.

4. **Non-Breaking Space:**

 ✨The non-breaking space entity, `&nbsp`, represents a space that prevents
    line breaks or word wraps. 
    It's useful for creating indentation or maintaining 
    spacing in HTML.

5. **Other Special Characters:**

   HTML entities can represent a wide range of special characters,
    including accented letters, mathematical symbols, arrows, and more.
     For example,
     ✨ `&eacute` represents the é character,
     ✨and `&mdash`  represents an em dash (—).


HTML entities are crucial for ensuring that your web pages are displayed
 correctly and consistently across different browsers and devices, 
 especially when dealing with non-standard characters or symbols. 
 They help maintain the integrity of your content and make it accessible to
  a global audience.

  /* semantic element  */

  Semantic elements in HTML are elements that convey meaningful information about
   the structure and content of a web page to both browsers and developers. 
   They provide context and describe the role of the contained content.
    Using semantic elements helps improve the accessibility,
     search engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability of web pages.
      Here are some common semantic elements in HTML:

1. **`<header>`:**

   The `<header>` element typically represents the introductory content at the
     beginning of a section or page. It often contains a site's logo,
      navigation menus, and other key information.

   ```html
   <header>
       <h1>My Website</h1>
       <nav>
           <ul>
               <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
               <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
               <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
           </ul>
       </nav>
   </header>
   ```

2. **`<nav>`:**

   The `<nav>` element is used to define a section of navigation links, 
    such as menus or lists of links to other parts of the website.

   ```html
   <nav>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
           <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
           <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
   </nav>
   ```

3. **`<main>`:**

   The `<main>` element represents the main content of a web page. There should be 
    only one `<main>` element on a page, and it should contain the primary content 
      of the page.

   ```html
   <main>
       <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
       <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
   </main>
   ```

4. **`<article>`:**

   The `<article>` element is used to define a self-contained piece of content 
    that can be distributed and reused independently. Articles can
     include blog posts, news articles, comments, and forum posts.

   ```html
   <article>
       <h2>Article Title</h2>
       <p>Article content goes here.</p>
   </article>
   ```

5. **`<section>`:**

   The `<section>` element is a generic container for grouping related content. 
    It doesn't have any specific semantic meaning on its own but is often used
     to create subsections within a document.

   ```html
   <section>
       <h2>Section Title</h2>
       <p>Section content goes here.</p>
   </section>
   ```

6. **`<aside>`:**

   The `<aside>` element represents content that is tangentially related to the 
    content around it. It's commonly used for sidebars, pull quotes,
     or advertisements.

   ```html
   <article>
       <h2>Article Title</h2>
       <p>Article content goes here.</p>
       <aside>
           <h3>Related Links</h3>
           <ul>

           </ul>
       </aside>
   </article>
   ```

7. **`<footer>`:**

   The `<footer>` element typically represents the closing section of a 
    document or a section, containing metadata, copyright information, 
    or contact details.

   ```html
   <footer>
       <p> 2023 My Website</p>
       <p>Contact: contact@example.com</p>
   </footer>
   ```

Using semantic elements helps make your HTML code more meaningful and easier
 to understand. It also benefits accessibility tools, search engines, and 
 developers who work with your code. When combined with appropriate use of
  headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) and other HTML elements, semantic elements 
    provide a clear and structured representation of your web content.

/* audio */----------------------[-]

<audio src="path"></audio>

/* multiple source  */

if the first audio do not supported the browser will mov the the second source 
<audio src="">
  <source src="path1" type="mme type1">
  <source src="path2"  type="mme type2">
  </audio>

/*Fallback Content:  */
 In case the browser doesn't support the <audio> element or any of the specified formats, 
 you can provide fallback content, which will be displayed to users. This is enclosed between
 the opening and closing <audio> tags.
<audio src="">
  <source src="path1" type="mime type">
  <source src="path2"  type="mime type">
  error message 
  </audio>




  /* attribute  */
 ✨ controls : show the controls 
 ✨  loop:  infinite  play to audio 
 ✨  autoplay : auto play the audio when the page load
 ✨  muted : mute the sound of the audio 
 ✨  type  :attribute to define the MIME type of the audio file. This helps 
            the browser identify which format to use. Common MIME types include 
            ✨audio/mpeg (MP3), 
            ✨ audio/ogg (Ogg Vorbis), 
            ✨ and audio/wav (Waveform Audio File Format).
 
 ✨ preload attribute: You can use the preload attribute to specify whether the browser
  should preload the audio content. It can take values like none, metadata, or auto. 
  
  1-preload="none": Use when you want to minimize initial page load times and conserve bandwidth.
   Suitable for pages with many media elements.

  2-preload="metadata": Use when you want to display essential information about the media 
  without fully downloading it. This can enhance user experience by showing the media's 
  duration or dimensions.

  3-preload="auto": Use when you want to ensure seamless playback by preloading the entire media
   file. This is ideal for media elements that are expected to be played immediately or for 
   longer media files

/* forms*/

/* form */ ----------------[]

HTML forms are a fundamental part of web development, allowing users to input data and
 submit it to web servers for processing. HTML forms are created using the <form> element
   and can include various attributes to control their behavior and appearance.
    Here are some important attributes used with the <form> element:
<form action=""></form>
/* form attributes :  */
✨action : 
The action attribute specifies the URL of the server-side script or endpoint to which
 the form data should be submitted when the user submits the form.
Example: <form action="/submit-form.php">

✨method:
The method attribute determines how the form data is sent to the server. It can be either GET or
 POST.
.GET appends the form data to the URL as query parameters. It is suitable for simple queries
 and should not be used for sensitive data.

 .POST sends the form data in the request body. It is suitable for larger data sets 
and sensitive information.
Example: <form action="/submit-form.php" method="POST">

✨target:
The target attribute specifies where the response from the server should be displayed.
  Common values include _self (default, same window), _blank (new tab or window), 
  or the name of an iframe.
 Example: <form action="/submit-form.php" method="POST" target="_blank">

✨name:
 The name attribute assigns a unique name to the form, which can be used to reference the form
 in JavaScript or CSS.
 Example: <form name="myForm">

✨autocomplete:
 The autocomplete attribute controls whether the browser should offer to autocomplete form 
 fields based on previously entered data.
 Values include on (default), off, username, current-password, etc.
 Example: <form action="/login" method="POST" autocomplete="on">

✨novalidate:
 The novalidate attribute, when present, disables browser-based form validation. 
 It is useful when you want to perform custom validation with JavaScript.
 Example: <form action="/submit-form.php" method="POST" novalidate>


✨accept-charset:
 The accept-charset attribute specifies the character encoding that the server should use 
 when processing form data.
 Example: <form action="/submit-form.php" method="POST" accept-charset="UTF-8">


  /* inputs :  */

  <input> Element (Text Input):

✨type: Specifies the type of input element
 (e.g., text, password, email, number, checkbox, radio, file, date, color, etc.).

 ✨name: Provides a name for the input element, which is used to identify 
the input data when the form is submitted.

✨value: Sets the initial value for the input element.
✨placeholder: Displays a hint or example text within the input field.
✨required: Specifies that the input field must be filled out before submitting the form.
✨disabled: Disables the input field, preventing user interaction.
✨readonly: Makes the input field read-only, preventing user editing.
✨maxlength: Sets the maximum number of characters allowed in a text input.
✨min and max (for number inputs): Define the allowable numeric range.

✨pattern: Specifies a regular expression pattern for input validation.
<label for="phone">Phone Number:</label>
<input type="text" id="phone" name="phone" pattern="\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" required>

✨autocomplete: Controls whether the browser should suggest autocompletions for the input.
✨autofocus: Automatically gives focus to the input element when the page loads.

/* label with input  */
<label for="inputId"></label>
<input type="radio" name="id" id="">

example : 
<!-- // link label with input using id  -->
<div>
 <input type="radio" name="os" value="windows" checked id="win"> 
 <label for="win">windows</label>
 </div>


 /* check box */
 <input type="checkbox" name="os" value="windows" checked id="win1"> 
       <label for="win1">windows</label>
     </div>
     <div>
        <input type="checkbox" name="os" value="mac" id="mac1" checked> 
        <label for="mac1">mac</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" name="os" value="linux" id="linux1"> 
        <label for="linux1">linux</label>
      </div>

  /* select   */

✨name: Provides a name for the dropdown list, used to identify the selected option(s) 
when the form is submitted.

✨size: Sets the number of visible options when the dropdown list is displayed.
✨multiple: Allows multiple options to be selected (only if present).
✨disabled: Disables the dropdown list, preventing user interaction.
✨required: Specifies that an option must be selected before submitting the form.
/* example  */
<label for="book">choose book</label>
  <select name="selectedBook" id="book" multiple>
  <optgroup label="cat1" >
    <option value="1" selected>book 1</option>
    <option value="2">book 2</option>
    <option value="3">book 3</option>
  </optgroup>
  <optgroup label="cat2">
    <option value="4">book gin 1</option>
    <option value="5">book gin 2</option>
    <option value="6">book gin 3</option>
  </optgroup>
  
/* text aria */
<textarea> Element (Multiline Text Input):

The <textarea> element allows users to enter multiple lines of text, 
  making it suitable for longer text entries, comments, or messages.

 ✨name: Provides a name for the textarea, used to identify the text input when the form is 
submitted.

 ✨rows and cols: Specify the initial number of rows and columns displayed in the textarea.
 ✨placeholder: Displays a hint or example text within the textarea.
 ✨required: Specifies that text must be entered into the textarea before submitting the form.
 ✨disabled: Disables the textarea, preventing user interaction.
 ✨readonly: Makes the textarea read-only, preventing user editing.

 /* example */
 <textarea name="textAriaContent" id="" cols="30" rows="10" placeholder="text"></textarea>

 /* date list  */

 The <datalist> element in HTML is used in conjunction with the <input> element to provide 
  a list of predefined options or suggestions for user input. It allows you to create an 
  auto-complete or suggestion feature for text input fields, making it easier for users to
   select valid input values while still allowing freeform text entry.

  1- Create a <datalist> Element:

    <datalist id="colors">
    <option value="Red">
    <option value="Green">
    <option value="Blue">
    <option value="Yellow">
    <option value="Orange">
</datalist>

2-Associate the <datalist> with an <input> Element:

You associate the <datalist> with an <input> element using the list attribute 
  and setting its value to the id of the <datalist>.

<label for="colorChoice">Choose a color:</label>
<input type="text" id="colorChoice" name="color" list="colors">


✨example : 
<form>
    <label for="colorChoice">Choose a color:</label>
    <input type="text" id="colorChoice" name="color" list="colors">
    <datalist id="colors">
        <option value="Red">
        <option value="Green">
        <option value="Blue">
        <option value="Yellow">
        <option value="Orange">
    </datalist>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>


/* Q and blockQuote wbr,button,bdi */

✨quote  is contain "" and it's an  inline element  => <q>Text</q>

✨block  quote element  => <blockquote>text</blockquote>

✨button element =>   <button>Text</button>

break line => <wbr>

bdi => change the directly of content 

/* example  */
<h1>2  <bdi>السلام عليكم</bdi>   world </h1>
